# LogicTreeNet: Failure-Aware Neural Reasoning

This repository contains the official implementation of **LogicTreeNet**, introduced in the paper:

> **“They Need to Learn from Their Mistakes: The LogicTreeNet Framework for Failure-Aware Neural Reasoning”**  


LogicTreeNet is a **neuro-symbolic reasoning framework** that learns not only from successful proofs but also from the *structure of failures*, enabling more efficient and interpretable meta-reasoning.

## 📘 Overview
LogicTreeNet combines neural policy learning with symbolic verification to build and refine proof trees dynamically, guided by a **failure-driven learning mechanism**.

## 🧩 Features
- Failure-aware reasoning loop  
- Proof-tree construction and verification  
- Self-corrective meta-reasoning policy
